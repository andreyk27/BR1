                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you&apos;re looking for environment setup 
                    instructions, they&apos;ve moved to <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an introduction to the 
                    documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>

                <h2>Core Components</h2>
                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React 
                    and the app platform&apos;s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your 
                    platform&apos;s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React 
                    components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. 
                    But first, let&apos;s cover how components work in React Native.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="react-fund">
                <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with 
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section 
                    can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <ul class="react-list">
                    <li class="react-item"><span class="bold-text">components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats 
                        in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
                    <li class="react-item"><span class="bold-text">JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write 
                        elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="grey-text">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>. The React docs have <a href="#">a 
                        comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can 
                        use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with 
                        curly braces inside <span class="grey-text">&lt;Text&gt;</span>.</li>
                    <li class="react-item"><span class="bold-text">props.</span> Props is short for &quot;properties&quot;.</li>
                    <li class="react-item"><span class="bold-text">state.</span>While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure 
                        how components render, state is like a component&apos;s personal data storage. State is useful for handling 
                        data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="text-input">
                <h2>Handling Text Input</h2>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a 
                    function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to 
                    be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p>For example, let&apos;s say that as the user types, you&apos;re translating their words into a different language. 
                    In this new language, every single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence &quot;Hello there Bob&quot; 
                    would be translated as &quot;&#127829; &#127829;&quot;.</p>
